This repository has 3 examples of how to use SDL and OpenGL in Go.

The first example uses only SDL to draw an image.

The second example uses SDL and OpenGL in immediate mode to draw a triangle.

The third example uses SDL and OpenGL in retained mode, with a shader.

Honestly, this repository is just for my benefit. It gives a good starting place
for figuring out those pesky problems that plague the start of a project.
